# Express API Project

This project was about creating API endpoint with express from a database which
is to be found as a json file in the data-folder.

## The problem

I started out with the bookID, and then continued to the areas where I think a
user would like to search for result. One is for searching title, authors and
language and another one is for isbn and/or isbn13. I also created a random
endpoint which returns one random book.
